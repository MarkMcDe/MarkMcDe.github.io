      I used to collect them as a kid. Unfortunately, none of them survived past
      my high school years. I wonder if they have any monetary value to collectors?
      <P>
      <I>Haven't heard of them yet, but with speculators ruining every other
      once-harmless kids' diversions, I wouldn't be surprised.</I>

      The ones I had were from the now-defunct "St Petersburg Aquatarium" (a
      small-scale version of Sea World in St. Petersburg Beach, Fla.) and from
      Sunken Gardens in St. Petersburg. From the Aquatarium, I had a seal (brown),
      a dolphin (grey), and a swordfish (blue). From Sunken Gardens, a cockatoo
      (white). Sunken Gardens still exists, and the last time I was there (3-4
      years ago) I *believe* they still had at least one Mold-a-Rama machine. I
      remember two things about making the figures I really loved; the smell of
      the hot plastic when they first came out of the machine, and having to hold
      them upsidedown until they cooled. Ah, the memories...

      There are a couple of mold a rama machines at the Milwaukee Zoo. The best
      one is a three monkey - see no evil hear no evil speak no evil withe the
      word Milwaukee at the base. I don't recall the price. Maybe $1.00. The museum
      of Science and Industry in Chicago has a variety of Molds - Lincolns head,
      submarine, space shuttle . Brookfield zoo has a dolphin moldarama as well.
      <P>
      Do you know who made the machines and distributes them? Perhaps they have
      a list of locations. Though all the machines that I have seen look pretty
      old.
      <P>
      <I>The Tribune article I cite elsewhere here has all the information I've
      come up with so far. When I get really obsessed, I'll try to find the proper
      curator at the Field or other museums and ask.</I>

      So I have been enchanted by Mold-A-Rama since I first met one at the Brookfield
      Zoo about four years ago. Last November, I turned a friend onto them by making
      him purchase the U-Boat at the Museum of Science and Industry. Sunday afternoon,
      I bought the Apatasaurus at the Field Museum (so I can confirm that it still
      works and is now the fabulous sum of $1.00) and immediately called him up
      to report on this. 
      <P>
      During our conversation, we were wondering how to assuage our growing curiosity
      about Mold-A-Rama basics (who could be repairing these things? Where are
      the parts still coming from?) and realized we could probably get our answer
      on... The Web. (Ah, omnipresence.) Thank you for your page, which answered
      our questions and helpfully pointed to the Tribune article.
      <P>
      You are indeed providing an invaluable public service!<BR>

      p.s. I can also confirm that there are three other dinosaur Mold-A-Ramas
      working in the Field Museum, including a T-Rex. I did not buy them yet (too
      much excitement--I have to save some for future visits) but I saw other kids
      getting theirs.

      <P>
      I was at the final four in San Antonio and the zoo there had at least 6 machines.
      For years I tried to explain this machine I used when I was 8 years old that
      made dinosaurs to my wife but she had no idea what I was talking about. It
      was great to actually see one.
      <P>
      I would love to buy one for a local museum. Have you ever seen one for sale?
