<p><b>Introduction: </b>Years from now, will our kids be able to
understand
the stuff we thought was funny? Probably not. After all, look at all
the
references to wartime rationing in all the Bugs Bunny cartoons. So
here's
an attempt to collect contemporary popular culture reference for future
generations. See something similar on MST3K or SNL? Send it to me!

<p align="left"> <font color="Navy">Angelyne</font>
</p>
</h3>
<p>
<b>Original source: </b>Perhaps the ultimate example of someone
becoming
famous simply by being famous. Angelyne has appeared in only three
movies
(most tellingly, her role in "Earth Girls are Easy" was "Blonde."),
Angelyne
has become know to all Hollywood for her billboards, showing her in a
bikini
or Lolita-type sunglasses, emphasizing her against-the-laws-of-physics
assets.
Angelyne has parlayed her fame into an international fan club, video
documentary,
and personal appearances in her Barbie-pink Corvette.
</p>
<p><i>Usage:</i> Angelyne's billboard over Hollywood Boulevard was
destoyed
in two movies within one year: "Escape from L.A." and "Volcano."

<p align="left"> <font color="Navy">Bizarro</font>
</p>
</h3>
<p>
<b>Original source: </b>Among the many supporting characters of the
Superman
comic books was Bizarro, an "imperfect duplicate" of the Man of Steel,
whose
face resembled white faceted stone, and who spoke in tortured English
constructions like "Me am going away now." Originally intended as a
tragic
figure, Bizarro eventually settled on his own planet, renaming it
Htrae,
and peopled it with thousands of imperfect duplicates of himself, Lois
Lane,
and the rest of the Superman family. In later encounters with Superman,
and
in a series of solo stories, the Bizarros demonstrated the great
lengths
they went to to live up to their Bizarro Code: "Us do the opposite of
all
Earthly things! Us hate beauty! Us love ugliness! Is a big crime to
make
anything perfect on Bizarro World!"
</p>
<p><i>Usage:</i> A mid-80's <b>"Saturday Night Live"</b> (NBC, 1975- )
sketch
by Michael O'Donoghue portrayed the working of an imagined Bizarro
White
House, occupied by a Bizarro President Reagan: "It am an international
crisis!
Quick, Bizarro President! Go to sleep!"
</p>
<p>Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a big Superman fan, peppered his <b>Seinfeld</b>
TV show (NBC, 1988- ) with Superman references. When the sitcom Jerry
is
pitching a sitcom pilot to NBC, his pal George decides they should get
at
least as much as Ted Danson, but his negotiating skills result in,
first,
the pilot being cancelled, and then, reinstated for less money. Jerry
berates
him with, "You don't negotiate to get a lower salary! That's
negotiation
on the Bizarro World!"
</p>
<p>In a later episode, ex-girlfreind Elaine meets someone who is just
like Jerry,
only courteous and informed on matters other than Superman and
cartoons.
Jerry refers to him as the "Bizarro Jerry." Elaine discovers this is
too
true when she visits the Bizarro Jerry's apartment, a cleaner mirror
image
of Jerry's, and his friends, versions of George and Kramer who behave
exactly
the opposite or Jerry's friends. At the end of the episode, we see the
Bizarro
Newman giving ballet tickets to the Bizarro Jerry and his friends,
leading
a group hug and the Bizarro Jerry proclaiming, "Me so happy, me could
cry!"

<p align="left"> <font color="Navy">-gate</font>
</p>
</h3>
<p>
<b>Original source:</b> The Democratic National Headquarters at the
Watergate
Hotel in Washington DC was burgled in 1972 by operatives of the
Committee
to Re-elect the President. The resulting investigation revealed many
crimes
committed or sanctioned by members of Richard Nixon's circle, which led
to
jail time for many Cabinet officers, and the resignation of Nixon
himself.
The suffix "-gate" has become attached to many investigations of
possible
wrongdoing, most often those involving the President. By creating a
"-gate,"
of course, political enemies hope to equate the current President's
indiscretions
with the ones that disgraced Nixon. Thus Reagan was subjected to
Irangate,
Bush to Contragate, Clinton to Filegate, Travelgate, Nannygate, etc.,
and
Dustin Hoffman subjected audiences to "Billy Bathgate." </p>

<p align="left"> <font color="Navy">Lord of the Dance, Riverdance</font>
</p>
</h3>
<p>
"Riverdance," the Branson of Irish traditional dancing shows, has
become
as much a part of PBS pledge weeks as a Peter, Paul &amp; Mary concert.
This
popularity has inspired one of the show's stars to start his own show,
"Lord
of Dance." A video is already being advertised showing the star, chest
hair
exposed, dancin' up a storm. This shot had already been dupplicated in
a
"Mystery Science Theatre 3000" bit, and an in-house commercial for
"Dexter's
Laboratory" (Dexter: Duke of the Dance!) on the Cartoon
Network.</p>

</h3>
<p>The practice of cartoon or comic book villains to launch into
extended harangues or exposition at the least opportune time, such as
when they have the hero at their mercy and a moment from a sure death.
Though vital to establish the villains' backstory or motivation, it
also either betrays the villains' weakness, or gives the hero a few
precious seconds to escape their predicament.</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> Although the
unnecessary monologue has long been a convention of superhero comics
and was used in the <a
 href="http://www.imdb.com/find?q=Austin%20powers;tt=on;nm=on;mx=20">Austin
Powers</a> movies, it was <a
 href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/incredibles">The Incredibles</a>
where the practice was actually named:<br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Frozone</b>:
So now I'm in deep trouble. I mean, one more jolt of this death ray and
I'm an epitaph. Somehow I manage to find cover and what does Baron von
Ruthless do? <br>
<b>Mr Incredible</b>:
[<i class="fine">Laughing</i>] He starts monologuing. <br>
<b>Frozone</b>: He starts monologuing! He starts this, like, prepared
speech about how "feeble" I am compared to him, how "inevitable" my
defeat is, how "the
world will soon be his," yadda yadda yadda. <br>
<b>Mr Incredible</b>: Yammering. <br>
<b>Frozone</b>: Yammering! I mean, the guy has me on a platter and he
won't shut up!

column on <a href="http://www.moviepoopshoot.com">Moviepoopshoot.com</a>
can't help but use the word, here describing Doctor Light's subduing of
the Justice League of America:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font class="text-medium-v">"As Snapper
Carr arrives at the Secret
Sanctuary in response to his JLA signal device, he finds not the League
but Dr. Light, who engages in some serious monologuing for the benefit
of the confused JLA mascot. Dr. Light, logically enough, has mastered
all the secrets of light, and planned to use these scientific
techniques for &#8211; what else? &#8211; world conquest."<br>
</font></p>
Regrettably, it's not Snapper who saves the day
while Light is monologuing, but Superman and Batman, who had suspected
something was fishy and switched costumes before Light transported them
to their respective death traps. Note that most DC Comics of the 1960's
featured plenty of monloguing on every cover, too.<br>

<h3> <font color="Navy">Shocked, shocked!</font>
</h3>
<p>
<b>Original source: </b>"Casablanca" (Motion picture: Warner Brothers,
1942)
</p>
<p>Events at Rick's Cafe Americain have become uncomfortable for
Casablanca's
Vichy government: Freedom fighter Victor Laszlo has led employees and
patrons
in a rendition of "La Marseillase" to drown some boisterous German
soldiers
singing "Die Wacht am Rhein." Major Strasser orders the happily corrupt
Vichy
constable Renault to find a reason to shut Rick's down. When asked by
Rick
what's going on, Renault replies, "I am shocked! shocked! to find that
there
is gambling going on here!" At that moment a croupier presents Renault
with
his own gambling winnings, which he politely accepts.

<p><i>Usage:</i> In a year-end piece recalling the revelation that many
of Chicago's
aldermen, policemen and city officials had accumulated thousands of
unpaid
parking tickets, the Chicago
<i><a href="www.chireader.com">Reader</a></i> recalled that; "The mayor
(Richard
M. Daley) was shocked, shocked to learn that so many trusted elected
officials
and civil servants were taking the city for a ride. He was even more
shocked
that city clerk Jim Laski blew the whistle." <i>"Uncivil Servants,"</i>
Dec.
27, 1996. Sec. I, p. 25.
</p>
<p>Often used to refer to someone, often a government official, who
professes
outrage at some unsavory activity performed by another, yet of which he
himself
is often guilty or obviously has full knowledge. </p>

<h3> <font color="Navy">Warning! Warning!</font>
</h3>
<p>
<b>Original Source:</b> "Lost in Space" (TV series: CBS 1965-68)
</p>
<p>The wandering space family Robinson were notified of impending
danger by
Robot, a contraption similar to Robby the Robot, which delivered its
warnings
by flailing its corrugated plastic tube arms and saying "Warning!
Warning!"
Dr. Smith, whose machinations caused the Robinsons to become lost in
the
first place, was usually the person being warned about, owing to his
attempts
to cut a deal for himself with the alien of the week.
</p>
<p>The phrase is usually delivered with an imitative waving of arms, or
at least
in a flat "robotic" tone of voice, to alert others of impending
travail.
</p>
<p><i>Sample usage:</i>
</p>
<p><b>Panel 1: </b>Dilbert's Boss: "We need to finish your program
twice as
fast, so I'm adding a person to help you."
</p>
<p><b>Panel 2:</b> Boss, walking away from cubicle: "You might need to
train
him a little before he's productive."
</p>
<p>Dilbert, waving his arms unseen (thought balloon): "Warning!
Warning! Dr.
Smith"
</p>
<p><b>Panel 3: </b>Added person, simian in aspect, and pointing to
computer:
"Tell me again what the big glowing thing is."
